You have just implemented the latest `<Alert>` component your team's designers have been waiting for so long. It looks so great. It contains a _prop_ `body` to display some text, and another _prop_ `icon` to reflect the criticity level of the alert. It matches perfectly the mockups and the specifications you were given for this component.

You integrated successfully this new `<Alert>` component into a brand new page of the application you're working on. This feature gets shipped to production. Everyone's happy.

_Unfortunately_. A few weeks later, the designers show you a new page that uses the `<Alert>` component. However, this time, you noticed that it has a `title` and some controls. The `body`'s text style is also different. Great. Now you have to wrap your `<Alert>`'s component with lots of conditions to render the new display while not breaking the old one. Your component is now already a messy bunch of code, and you pray a moment for the hard time the next developer will have when working on it.

The **problem** of your component is quite simple: it is not **customizable**.

The **solution** to this problem: the **Compound** pattern. And that's what we'll go through in this article.

## Composition

The **Compound** pattern is a simple extension to [Composition](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html). Basically, it relies on the idea that components should render any `children` given by their parents, and should not need to know what those `children` contain. This is especially true for "box" & "wrapper" like components. It allows you to create very flexible components.

For example:

```jsx
const Box = ({ children }) => <div className="StyledBox">{children}</div>

const App = () => (
  <>
    <Box>
      <p>I'm a paragraph in a box</p>
    </Box>
    <Box>
      <h2>I'm a title in a box</h2>
    </Box>
  </>
)
```

Applying the **Composition** pattern to our use-case enabled us to use the `<Box>` component in multiple use-cases. We were able to provide it with different contents: a paragraph and a title.

This pattern is exactly what **Compound components** are built with: allow other developers to fully customize the content of your components.

## You said Compound ?

Now we've seen what **Composition** applied to React is, let's see what the **Compound** pattern brings in addition to it.

### Compound in a nutshell

Here's my succinct definition of the pattern, applied to React:

**The pattern consists into decoupling a complex component into a `root` component and `children` components bound to it.**

> Not quite...tangible, right ? Don't worry, we'll go through examples later ðŸ™‚.

### When to use it...or not

This pattern cannot, and should not, be applied to all your components. For example, it should not be applied to your [atomic components](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), because it simply doesn't make any sense to compound an _atom_.

Instead, it makes total sense when used in your _molecule_ components, that are made of _atomic_ components.

For example, the pattern cannot be applied to a `<Button>` component because it's an atomic component. However, it's perfect for an `<Alert>` component because it's a _molecule_ component, which renders a view built with multiple atomic components, like a `<Paragraph>` or a `<Button>`.

## How to apply it

The part you were waiting for ðŸ˜‰.

Since an example is worth a thousand words, let's work on our `<Alert>` component from the introduction.

### Some context first

Before anything, let's make some _specs_ together (well, I'll write them, but you can read them, team work!).

Here's what our `<Alert>` component should do:

- It can have a title and a body.
- It can have controls like buttons.
- It has 3 states: `success`, `error` and `info`.
- Those states are simply used to determine the `background-color` of the `<Alert>`.

Basically, when the status is set to `info`, it will look like this:

![The Alert component](./alert.webp)

The primary approach of someone new to React would probably be to create a single component `<Alert>` with **props** to implement the expected behavior. We would have props for the title and the body texts, and a prop for the buttons as an `array` of `objects`.

We'd probably end up with something similar to this:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Alert from './Alert'
import { someFunc, someOtherFunc } from './functions'

const MyAlert = () => (
  <Alert
    status="info"
    title="This is a title"
    body="This is a body"
    buttons={[
      {
        label: 'Confirm',
        onClick: someFunc,
      },
      {
        label: 'Close',
        onClick: someOtherFunc,
      },
    ]}
  />
)
```

This implementation works, sure. But that makes your component way too much _resilient_. It works for a particular use-case, but it's hardly scalable to others. Remember the situation of the developer in the introduction?

What if we need the `body` with a particular style on some pages ? What if we need **more** than 2 bodies ? What if we want to use a `link` instead of a `button` ? The above implementation doesn't not allow that. Not without tons of `if` inside the `<Alert>`'s code, that is.

Don't get me wrong, components **should be** resilient enough to be robust when they are integrated into larger applications. But here the resilience is **too** strong, especially when you are building a re-usable component.

### The solution

Rather than using props to specify the entire component, we can apply the **Compound** pattern.

Remember its (well, my) [definition](#compound-in-a-nutshell) above ? Well, here our `root` component is going to be the `<Alert>` itself, and the `children` components are going to be the `<Title>`, the `<Body>`, and the `<Button>`. We'll also have a `<Controls>` component to containerize the buttons.

The `children` components will be accessible as **properties** from the `root` component. This is one variation of the pattern, we'll see that there also are other approaches. However, this is the _best_ solution in my eyes, and I'll detail why later in this article. However note that the variation itself is not really important, the pattern remains the same.

That said, here's how our components **hierarchy** will look like:

- `<Alert>`
- `<Alert.Body>`
- `<Alert.Button>`
- `<Alert.Controls>`
- `<Alert.Title>`

The main component, `<Alert>` is really light. All it does is setting the correct `background-color` of the alert, and it simply renders any `children` you pass to it. Remember: **Composition** ðŸ˜‰.

Simplified for the purposes of this article, it will look similar to this:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const Alert = ({ children, status = 'info' }) => {
  return <div className={`AlertContainer-${status}`}>{children}</div>
}
```

It mainly acts as a container. Now if you add the `<Alert.Body>` to the example:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const Body = (props) => <p className="AlertBody" {...props} />

const Alert = ({ children, status = 'info' }) => {
  return <div className={`AlertContainer-${status}`}>{children}</div>
}

// We expose the children components here, as properties.
Alert.Body = Body

// We only export the root component.
export default Alert
```

The same goes for the other `children` components: the Title, the Controls and the Button.

What is awesome with this pattern, is the fact there is not a unique way of using the component. We can use it and override it **any way** we want to.

Here's **one possible** way to use it, and the one that renders the Alert in the image above:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Alert from './Alert'
import { someFunc, someOtherFunc } from './functions'

const MyAlert = () => (
  <Alert status="info">
    <Alert.Title>Alert, aliens have invaded the ship!</Alert.Title>
    <Alert.Body>Begin emergency protocols.</Alert.Body>
    <Alert.Body>This is not an exercice.</Alert.Body>
    <Alert.Controls>
      <Alert.Button onClick={someFunc}>Begin</Alert.Button>
      <Alert.Button onClick={someOtherFunc}>Give up</Alert.Button>
    </Alert.Controls>
  </Alert>
)
```

You want to add a `body` before the `title` ? No problem. You want to use a `h5` element for one of the bodies ? No problem. You want to add a `link` in the controls ? No Problem.

Here you go:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Alert from './Alert'
import { someFunc } from './functions'

const MyAlert = () => (
  <Alert status="info">
    <Alert.Body>Begin emergency protocols.</Alert.Body>
    <Alert.Title>Alert, aliens have invaded the ship!</Alert.Title>
    <h5>This is not an exercice.</h5>
    <Alert.Controls>
      <Alert.Button onClick={someFunc}>Begin</Alert.Button>
      <a href="https://google.com">Give up</a>
    </Alert.Controls>
  </Alert>
)
```

That's the power of the pattern: we keep the **functional** behavior of our `<Alert>` component, while we can **customize** its content any way we want, if needs be.

Also, it really helps other developers to understand and "preview" the DOM your component will render, since the pattern is following a [Declarative paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming),
just like pure HTML does.

This pattern is a **must do** for components libraries, as it offers so much customization to its users. The most used react libraries out there are built on this pattern: [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Ant Design](https://ant.design), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Components-extra](https://components-extra.netlify.app/) (okay, this one is mine, I'm guilty), and many others.

### For skeptics

When you have been using the "naive & default" approach forever when using React, it can take some time to fully understand how powerful the pattern is.

At least, I was skeptic for some time.

The first version of my [react components](https://components-extra.netlify.app/) lib was not implementing this pattern, and that was a big mistake. I use it on several projects, and I quickly realized that its components were not customizable enough for all my use-cases. So I rewrotte it entirely using the **Compound** pattern, and it solved many, many problems.

You could also argue that this pattern makes your components not _resilient_ enough. And to this question I'll answer simply: nothing stops you to abstract it by wrapping one of its implementations in another component of your own. Just like in the above examples, in the `<MyAlert>` component. You won't have to duplicate it doing so.

You could also argue that this pattern increase the _verbosity_ of React, which is already quite verbose to start with. Well, to that I will answer that, according to me, trading some extra lines to get a fully customizable component is the best deal you can make.

## The variations

Like I wrote earlier, there are two variations of the pattern: one consists into adding the `children` components as **properties** in the `root` component, like in this article, and the other consists into exporting them aside the `root` one, as independant components.

So, in other words, if we use the same example: `<Alert.Body>` versus `<AlertBody>`.

In my opinion, the first variation is the best one because:

- The `children` components are not exported, thus it helps the users to understand that
  they must be used within the `root` component.
- It doesn't mess up your exports, and helps prevent export collisions.
- You don't end up with `<AlertControlsLeftButton>`-like names, which are hardly readable.
- You can take advantage of TypeScript to define those properties inside the `root` component.

However, there is one dis-advantage, which is [Tree Shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking). Since all the `children` components are imported as properties, your bundler will not tree-shake them if, even if you do not use all of them in your code. The 2nd variation (used by Material-UI), will enable Tree-Shaking by design.

## To conclude

If you've already opened your favourite IDE to start experimenting with this pattern, or if you discovered it thanks to this article, then I hope you enjoyed this article and that it was not _too_ messy, as my articles usually are ðŸ™ƒ.

On a more serious note, the **Compound** pattern really is a great solution to enhance considerably the custumizability of your components. However, please note that it's great only when applied on complex and _molecule-like_ components. As always, it's a question of finding the best balance for your problem.
